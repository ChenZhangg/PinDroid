{"name":"Pindroid","tagline":"Pinboard Bookmarks for Android","body":"PinDroid is an Android client app for the [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in ) social bookmarking service.  PinDroid is a port of [DeliciousDroid](http://code.google.com/p/deliciousdroid/).\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nPinDroid is in the [Play Store](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pindroid).\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n\r\n  * Background sync for bookmarks\r\n  * Bookmarks are cached to allow offline viewing and to reduce network traffic\r\n  * Accounts managed through Android's built-in account manager\r\n  * Multiple accounts supported\r\n  * Add, view, edit, and delete bookmarks\r\n  * Bookmark titles, tags, and notes are searchable from both the global search and from within the app\r\n  * Home screen widget for quick access to several activities\r\n  * Code is licensed under the GPL v3\r\n\r\n## Translations ##\r\n  * English\r\n  * Finnish\r\n  * Spanish\r\n  * German\r\n  * Korean\r\n\r\n### Note: _Requires_ Android 4.x+ (API Level 14+). ###\r\n\r\n## Known Issues ##\r\n\r\nThese are some of the known issues in the current build of PinDroid.  Feel free to open an issue if you encounter a bug/issue not listed here, or have an idea for an enhancement.\r\n\r\n  * Certain features from DeliciousDroid have not been ported yet due to limitations in Pinboard's API, including contact syncing and viewing network bookmark lists.\r\n  * HTC Sense 4+ (Jelly Bean) devices have a bug that causes them to only display one share target per app in the stock HTC apps (Internet, Messages, etc).  As a workaround, there is a [standalone app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid.readlater) to add the share target and forward it to the main PinDroid app.  Note that the main PinDroid app must be installed for this to work.\r\n  * PinDroid can be moved to an sd card, however this will cause you to have to re-login every time you reboot your device.  Doing this may also cause widgets to not work in some cases.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8Zcr2z1l.png)  ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/RU2K2rSl.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/RBCoxicl.png)  ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HqtmkHUl.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pgcpb1Dl.png)  ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8kh0qa6l.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/v9tkqZ3l.jpg) \r\n","google":"UA-64534566-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
